# World-Wild-Web-AI-And-MCP-Hack-Night
Hey, thanks for joining us for WWW AI & MCP Hacknight! In this repo, you'll find all the information you need to get started with the hacknight.

We recommend getting familiar with the challenge before the hacknight, as it will help you get started faster.

## Prerequisites
- Your own laptop
- Node.js and a JS package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) installed
- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- A GitHub account
- [Genimi API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

## The Challenge
This hacknight is all about exploration and creativity with AI agents and MCP servers! Build something that excites you - whether it's practical, experimental, or just fun.

### Core Components
Your project will consist of two main parts (or at least one of them!):
1. **An AI Agent**: A chat-based assistant with its own personality and purpose
2. **Backend Services**: MCP server, agent tools and APIs that give your agent real-world capabilities

### What We Provide to Get Started:
- A [template](/ai-agent-template/) based on the [Cloudflare Chat Agent Starter Kit](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents-starter) with:
  - Built-in MCP Server connection tools (the AI agent needs an MCP server with sse endpoint to connect)
  - Integration with the [Fiberplane AI agents playground](https://github.com/fiberplane/fiberplane/tree/main/packages/agents)
- Access to Fiberplane's Codegen platform for generating:
  - MCP servers that run on Cloudflare
  - Hono APIs for integrating with external services (Notion, GitHub, etc.)


### Quick Start
1. Clone the template from the [ai-agent-template](/ai-agent-template) directory
2. Follow the setup instructions in the template's README
3. Test that your AI agent works locally

**During the Hacknight**:
1. Get access to Codegen and create your MCP server
2. Connect your agent to the MCP server (Note: Choose an MCP server without authentication)
3. Start building your features!

### Need Inspiration?
While you're free to build anything, here are some ideas for your themed AI agent. Think of the overall topic: **Personal AI Automation**
- A language learning tutor
- A mental wellness coach
- An email assistant
- A music discovery assistant
- Smart Home orchestrator
- Personal CRM

### Fiberplane Codegen Project
For access to the early pre-beta version of Fiberplane's Codegen project, please join [Fiberplane's Discord](https://discord.gg/NarC9cf5vP) and share your GitHub handle in the `#codegen` channel. We will add you to the platform.


## Examples, Resources and Inspiration
- [Cloudflare agents docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/)
- [Selfies to stickers agent](https://github.com/craigsdennis/event-stickers-agent)
- [Remote MCP server on Cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/demos/remote-mcp-authless)

## Evaluation Criteria
- Live demos are preferred over presentation slides
- Agents and MCP server should run on Cloudflare (can be also locally)
- Extra points if you add a code-generated MCP server to your AI agent
- Nothing to demo? Don't worry - you can share your code and learnings from the evening

### Submission
If you'd like to present your project:
1. Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/vRmirHdUuhCj5pg76)
2. Join the Google Meet call we'll share near the end of the event

We're using a shared call to make presentations smooth and avoid switching between computers.
